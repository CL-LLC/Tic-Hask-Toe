# **Assignment 1-3: Reading Haskell Documentation**

Use Hoogle to look up the following list functions and practice using them in a GHCi REPL session:

* `(:)` & `(++)`:
  >Called "cons" and "append", respectively
  >These functions are "infix" operators: they're usually inserted between their arguments like other operators we've seen (`+`, `-`, `&&`, `||`):
  ```shell
  $ cabal repl

  Main> 1 : [2, 3]
  [1, 2, 3]
  Main> 1 : []
  [1]
  Main> "I choose you, " ++ "Pikachu!"
  "I choose you, Pikachu!"
  ```
  >Like all operators, they can also be used in prefix notation by enclosing them in parentheses:
  ```shell
  Main> (++) "I choose you, " "Pikachu!"
  "I choose you, Pikachu!"
  ```
  >Pay careful attention to the signatures of these functions:
  ```shell
  Main> :t (:)
  (:)  ::  a  -> [a] -> [a]
  Main> :t (++)
  (++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
  ```
  >"cons" takes a value of any type `a` and a list of other `a` values, and prepends the value to the list.
  >"append" takes two lists containing values of any type `a` and appends the second list to the first.
  >New Haskellers frequently confuse the use of these functions and encounter type errors. How can we add a single element to the end of a list? Note that we can convert any regular value into a list (called a "singleton") by enclosing it in square brackets.
* `concat`
  >Notice `concat`'s signature:
  ```shell
  Main> :t concat
  concat :: Foldable t => t [a] -> [a]
  ```
  >What this means is that `concat` can take any collection `t` containing lists of `a` values, and concatenate the contents into a list of `a` values - provided the collection is an instance of the `Foldable` class.
  >For our purposes, the only `Foldable` collection we'll be using with `concat` is a list of lists, so we can understand the signature more clearly as this:
  ```haskell
  concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
  ```
  >In other words, `concat` takes a nested list (a list of lists of `a` values) and flattens it into a single list of `a` values.
* `null`
* `head`, `tail`, `last`, `init`
  >**Note:** these functions throw runtime exceptions when called on empty lists, so they must be used cautiously.
* `elem` & `notElem`
  >As with `concat`, these functions work on various `Foldable` collections - not just lists - but we'll be using them with lists exclusively. Consider the simplified signatures below:
  ```haskell
  elem    :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
  notElem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
  ```
  >The `Eq a` constraint says that whichever type `a` ends up being, its values must be comparable for equality.
  >In practice, `elem` and `notElem` are typically used with **infix** notation for readability, like the various binary operators we've encountered (`+`, `-`, `&&`, `||`). We can make any binary function infix by enclosing it in backticks and inserting it between its two arguments:
  ```shell
  Main> 'x' `elem` "Snorlax"
  True
  Main> 'z' `notElem` "Snorlax"
  True
  ```
* `replicate`
  >This function is surprisingly useful. We'll use it to construct an empty board in our game.
* `splitAt`
  >Try using this function with negative and out-of-range index values. What happens?
* `repeat`
  >Using `repeat` on its own in GHCi will print an infinite list that doesn't terminate. Use `CTRL + C` to interrupt the execution.
* `zip`
  >Try using `zip` with an infinite list constructed with `repeat` and a second, finite list:
    ```shell
    Main> zip (repeat 0) [1, 2, 3]
    ```
  >Which unique feature of Haskell makes this result possible? What would happen if we tried something similar in other languages?
* `intercalate`
  >This function isn't part of Haskell's Prelude, so you'll need to import the `Data.List` module in your REPL session as follows:
    ```shell
    Main> :m Data.List
    Prelude Data.List>
    ```
  >You can now run this command to verify that the function is available:
    ```shell
    Prelude Data.List> :t intercalate
    intercalate :: [a] -> [[a]] -> [a]
    ```

There are many other helpful list functions available in Haskell's Prelude and the `Data.List` module. We'll use only some of them in this course, but we encourage you to explore the documentation for [Data.List](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/Data-List.html) on Hoogle and familiarize yourself with its functions for future reference.
